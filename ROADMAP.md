# F1 Square — Roadmap to completion (v0.15.0 → v0.19.0)

The genuine-proof layer (`F1Square/`) builds the 𝔽₁ / Riemann-Hypothesis program from first
principles in **pure Lean 4** (Lean core + UOR-Foundation, **no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`,
choice-free** — `{propext, Quot.sound}` only). Every commit is green and `#print axioms`-audited by
`scripts/honesty_audit.sh`.

**The bright line (permanent).** The honesty layer is a *verifier*, not a prohibition. The crux fields
`hodgeIndexHolds` and `liPositivityHolds` (both = RH) stay `none` until a genuine, audited, axiom-clean
proof exists. De-hedging removes *false modesty* about proven results; it never adds *false confidence*.
**The gate decides what is asserted, not ambition** — anything that does not close honestly stays an
explicit interface, exactly as the existing `Li`/`Crux` interfaces do, never faked.

The remaining construction is scoped into five releases (stages **A–E**). Each is multi-commit, green
at every commit, axiom-clean, and resolved by analyzing the implementation here plus deep-research where
the literature is needed. Uncertainty (especially on the geometric frontier) is a research input, not a
stop sign — the focus is always the **construction of the F1 square**, to completion.

## Status recap (`F1SquareStatus`, `F1Square.lean`)

## v0.15.0 — (A) The complex analytic engine: exponential core **[shipped]**

Lift the analytic substrate from ℝ to ℂ and make `exp` a homomorphism — the prerequisite that the rest of
stage A (ζ for complex argument) builds on. **Shipped:**

- `Analysis/ComplexExp.lean` — `Cexp z = exp(re z)·(cos(im z) + i·sin(im z))` from `RexpReal/Rcos/Rsin`,
  with the component identities and `Cexp 0 ≈ 1` (`Cexp_zero`, `RexpReal_zero`, `Rcos_zero`, `Rsin_zero`).
- `Analysis/CosSinAdd.lean`, `Analysis/CosSinBound.lean` — **the trigonometric keystone** `cos² + sin² ≈ 1`
  (`Rcos_sq_add_sin_sq`) via the trig Cauchy product from scratch, giving `|cos| ≤ 1`, `|sin| ≤ 1`.
- `Analysis/ExpRealAdd.lean` — **the exponential keystone** `RexpReal_add` (`exp(x+y) ≈ exp x · exp y` on
  all of ℝ), the roadmap's technical core of stage A: the signed Cauchy-product functional equation
  (`expSum_add_le_signed`) lifted to the diagonal through a deep reference depth (`rexp_add_gap`,
  `RexpReal_add_aux`, `rexp_factor_reconcile`), plus the reusable ζ-tail toolkit (corner bound,
  reconciliation, uniform partial-sum bound, factorial decay).
- `Analysis/ComplexMod.lean`, `Analysis/ComplexPow.lean` — `nˢ` (`ncpow n s = Cexp(s·log n)`, positive-integer
  base) and the **modulus identity** `|Cexp z|² = (exp Re z)²` (`Cexp_normSq`) / `|nˢ|² = (exp(Re s·log n))²`
  (`ncpow_normSq`), the analytic payoff of `cos² + sin² = 1`.
- **De-hedges:** "exp/cos/sin without addition laws" → "exp is a homomorphism; `|cos|,|sin| ≤ 1`; the complex
  exponential and `nˢ` with their modulus".
- **Stays open:** ζ at complex `s` (the convergence gate `exp∘log = id`, see v0.15.1); critical strip; zeros; crux.

## The v0.15.x series — (A, continued) completing ζ for complex argument

Stage A's remaining original goals (ζ for `Re s > 1`, the prime side, the `n = 1` decomposition) are gated on
a single **discovered dependency**: convergence of `Σ n^{-s}` needs `|n^{-s}| = n^{-Re s}`, i.e.
`exp(log n) = n`. Because `log` is built independently as `2·artanh((x−1)/(x+1))`, this is **not**
definitional, and every elementary route (`exp(t) ≥ 1+t` + multiplicativity via `RexpReal_add` + the two-sided
exp bounds) only *squeezes* `1 + log x ≤ exp(log x) ≤ 1/(1−log x)` — never pinning equality (iterated squaring
amplifies the second-order error). The honest conclusion: `exp∘log = id` requires a genuine **power-series
composition** (compose the exp factorial series with the artanh geometric series ⇒ `exp(2·artanh w) =
(1+w)/(1−w)`), a from-scratch build of its own. It is scoped as its own release so the shipped exponential
core is not held hostage to it.

- **v0.15.1 — `exp∘log = id` (the power-series composition gate).** Build `exp(log x) ≈ x` (equivalently
  `exp(2·artanh w) = (1+w)/(1−w)`). `log` multiplicativity `log(ab) = log a + log b` (artanh addition formula
  + `RexpReal_add`) reduces it to a base identity, but that base needs the composition. Research-grade in this
  from-scratch setting; **honesty gate** — if it does not close axiom-clean, the ζ-complex tail (v0.15.2) ships
  its convergence as a documented interface, never faked.
- **v0.15.2 — real powers `nᶜ` + `Analysis/ZetaC.lean`.** `exp(c·log n) = nᶜ` (v0.15.1 + `RexpReal_add`), the
  tail bound `|n^{-s}| = n^{-Re s}` (uses `|cos|,|sin| ≤ 1`, shipped), and `Czeta s` for `Re(s) > 1` as
  `Σ n^{-s}` with a rigorous complex tail, mirroring `Zeta.lean`. **De-hedges:** "ζ only at integer `s ≥ 2`"
  → "ζ(s), complex `s`, `Re(s) > 1`".
- **v0.15.3 — `Analysis/Mangoldt.lean` + the `n = 1` decomposition.** von Mangoldt `Λ` and the
  explicit-formula **prime side** `Σ_p Σ_k log p · h(k log p)` as a real (finite for compactly-supported `h`),
  and the **Bombieri–Lagarias `λₙ = λₙ^{arith} + λₙ^{∞}` for `n = 1`** as a theorem (uses the `γ`/`log 4π`/`λ₁`
  of v0.14.0), promoting `Li.LiDecomposition` from inhabited-interface to a proven instance.
- **Stays open across v0.15.x:** critical strip, zeros, crux.

## v0.16.0 — (B) Analytic continuation & higher Li coefficients

The heavy analytic mechanization: ζ off the convergent regime and the `λₙ` for `n ≥ 2`.

- `Analysis/Gamma.lean` — `Γ` via Spouge/Lanczos (uses `ncpow`/`Cexp`); the archimedean (`Γ′/Γ`) place.
- `Analysis/EulerMaclaurin.lean` — periodic-Bernoulli remainder (fix-`K`, grow-`N`) → `Czeta` on the
  **critical strip** as an `ExactBoundedReal`.
- Higher **Stieltjes `γₙ`** by the same engine → individual **`λₙ` values** for `n ≥ 2`, with
  `λ₁`-style positivity certificates for *specific small* `n` (e.g. `Pos λ₂`).
- **De-hedges:** "genuine `λₙ` values deferred" → built for `n ≥ 2`; critical-strip ζ.
- **Honesty gate:** research-grade; whatever does not close axiom-clean stays an interface.
- **Stays open:** `λₙ > 0 ∀ n` (= RH).

## v0.17.0 — (C) The arithmetic square 𝕊

Construct the object the whole program runs on. The frontier is less unknown than it looks: the
candidate bi-tropical model, the proved mechanism, and the §2.3 control already constrain it; the gap is
making `𝕊 = Spec ℤ ×_𝔽₁ Spec ℤ` (the `F ⊗_𝔹 F` tensor) canonical.

- Construct canonical `𝕊` and its intersection lattice (`surfaceConstructed`, `parallelPencilFinding`).
- Lift `intersectionTemplateValid` / `ampleClassExists` / `classGroupFinitelyGen` from the
  product-of-curves template to canonical `𝕊` (the `Crux.Polarized` instance becomes `𝕊`, not the template).
- **De-hedges:** `surfaceConstructed`, `parallelPencilFinding`, and the three template fields → canonical 𝕊.
- **Method:** analyze `Mechanism`/`Bridge`/`Tropical` + deep-research the 𝔽₁ tensor / arithmetic-surface
  literature (Deninger, Connes–Consani, Borger) to fix the canonical construction.

## v0.18.0 — (D) The bridge and the crux

State the geometric↔analytic equivalence faithfully, and **attempt** the crux on canonical `𝕊`.

- The equivalence `Crux.HodgeIndex 𝕊 ⟺ Li.LiPositive λ` (classical; stated as a faithful theorem/interface).
- The **Hodge-index / Li-positivity attempt** on canonical `𝕊` under the gate. This is where RH closes
  **iff** it closes: `hodgeIndexHolds` / `liPositivityHolds` flip `none → some true` **iff** a genuine,
  audited, axiom-clean proof lands — otherwise they stay `none` and RH stays open, and the release still
  ships the bridge substrate. No fake, no `decide`-over-finite-N, no template substitution (see the
  faithfulness cautions in `Crux.lean` / `Li.lean`).

## v0.19.0 — (E) Completion: the explicit formula and the F1-square roll-up

Assemble the full Weil explicit formula and the final status record.

- The complete `Li.ExplicitFormulaTrace` — the **zero side** (`Σ` over the nontrivial zeros). This is
  RH-equivalent: it becomes provable exactly when the crux (D) closes; until then it remains the honest
  interface it is today.
- Retire the remaining honest interfaces (`LiAgreesWith`, …) as theorems where the now-built ζ/`λ` make
  them so.
- The final F1-square status roll-up and a v1.0.0-candidate state.

---

## What stays open regardless

If v0.18 / v0.19 do not close the crux axiom-clean, `hodgeIndexHolds` / `liPositivityHolds` stay `none`
and **RH stays open** — the releases still ship every surrounding construction. The bright line is
permanent: the crux is de-hedged iff RH is proven, and it is not until it is.
