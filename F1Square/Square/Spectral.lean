F1 square — v0.18.0 stage D, brick 3: the SPECTRAL SQUARE interface and **the bridge** —
the geometric and analytic faces of the crux are equivalent, as a theorem.

THE OBJECT (interface). v0.17.0 proved that canonical `𝕊`'s coarse numerical lattice is
pencil-blind (`Square.square_hodge_pencil_blind`): the trace datum that the function-field
mechanism runs on (`BridgeFF.ff_trace_datum`: `Δ·Γ = q+1−a` INSIDE the lattice) is absent,
relocated to the spectral side (T4: the `H¹` on which the scaling flow acts with spectrum =
the zeta zeros). `SpectralSquare` is that enrichment as an interface: it carries
  • `lam` — the Li/trace data of `H¹` (for the GENUINE instance, the Li coefficients
    `λₙ = Σ_ρ [1 − (1−1/ρ)ⁿ]` of ζ);
  • `cSq` — the self-intersections `⟨Cₙ, Cₙ⟩` of the primitive spectral classes;
  • `dict` — THE DICTIONARY: `⟨Cₙ, Cₙ⟩ = −2λₙ`. This is the Deninger reading of Li's
    criterion (Deninger, *Motivic L-functions and regularized determinants*, Proc. Symp.
    Pure Math. 55 (1994); the Hodge-index formulation of Weil positivity), normalized
    exactly as the function-field model derives it: `BridgeFF.primDG_sq` gives
    `D°² = −2·(Hasse form)` — the `−2` is the lattice's, not a choice. For ζ the chain
    "RH ⟺ Weil positivity ⟺ λₙ ≥ 0 ∀n" is CLASSICAL (Weil 1952; Li, J. Number Theory 65
    (1997); Bombieri–Lagarias, J. Number Theory 77 (1999); Bombieri, *Remarks on Weil's
    quadratic functional*, Rend. Mat. Acc. Lincei 11 (2000)).

THE BRIDGE (theorems, the stage-D release goal): for ANY spectral square,
    `spectral_bridge_nonneg` :  Hodge-index negativity (semidefinite face) ⟺ `Li.LiNonneg lam`
    `spectral_bridge_pos`    :  Hodge-index negativity (definite face)     ⟺ `Li.LiPositive lam`
    `crux_faces_equivalent`  :  `SpectralCrux S ⟺ Li.LiCrux S.lam`
— the geometric and analytic faces of the crux are THE SAME proposition through the
dictionary. The equivalence is a genuine constructive theorem (the order algebra
`−2λ ≤ 0 ⟺ λ ≥ 0` on Bishop reals, with the doubling lemmas proved at sequence level).

FAITHFULNESS (the standing cautions, all enforced):
  • The crux is `SpectralCrux` of the GENUINE instance — whose `lam` is the Li sequence of
    ζ and whose `cSq` comes from the actual `H¹` pairing. NEITHER is constructed here
    (`T4`/§3.4: that construction is the program's remaining frontier). The fields
    `hodgeIndexHolds`/`liPositivityHolds` stay `none`.
  • `spectralTwoSlice` below is the INHABITING instance: its `lam` carries the genuine
    certified `λ₁, λ₂` (v0.14.0/v0.16.0) and its `cSq` is defined THROUGH the dictionary —
    it demonstrates the interface is real and gives the geometric face its first two
    genuine negativity slices (`spectral_evidence_two`). It is NOT the crux, and that is
    itself a THEOREM (`spectralTwoSlice_not_crux`: its `n ≥ 3` slices vanish, so its
    strict positivity provably FAILS — no instance built from finitely many certified
    slices can be passed off as RH).
  • The finite-check guard transfers to the geometric face (`spectral_iff_all_upTo`):
    no finite run of negativity checks reaches the crux.

    RH is CLASSICAL (Li 1997, Bombieri–Lagarias 1999); the genuine `cSq`/`H¹` is the open
