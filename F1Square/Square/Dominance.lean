F1 square — v0.19.0 stage E, brick 3: **THE DOMINANCE FACE OF THE CRUX** — the crux as a
SINGLE UNIFORM BOUND: the oscillating arithmetic part can never overwhelm the archimedean
trend.

THE SHAPE. Through the explicit-formula trace `λₙ = λₙ^{arith} + λₙ^{∞}` (the realized
`Analysis.WeilTrace`), the crux `λₙ > 0 ∀n` says exactly: at every `n`, the arithmetic
part's negative excursion stays strictly below the archimedean value. `Dominates B arith
arch` packages that as ONE object — a single bound sequence `B` with
      `−B(n) ≤ arith(n)`   (the bound controls the oscillation's negative excursions)
      `arch(n) − B(n) > 0` (the bound stays strictly below the archimedean trend)
— and `Dominated arith arch` is its single existential. This is the strongest honest shape
available for the universal:
  • it is genuinely universal WITHOUT enumeration — no slice ladder, no finite checks
    (which provably never reach the crux: `Li.liPositive_iff_all_upTo`,
    `spectral_iff_all_upTo`); the open content is relocated into ONE object, the bound;
  • the sign-dichotomy is CLEAN — there is no third option to eliminate and no crossover
    case split: the formulation is sign-agnostic in both parts (for small `n` the
    archimedean part is the NEGATIVE one — `λ₁^{∞} ≈ −0.5541`, `λ₂^{∞} ≈ −0.8745`,
    independently re-verified to 30 digits, with the arithmetic part carrying the
    positivity; asymptotically the roles swap: the archimedean part grows like
    `(n/2)·log n + c·n + O(1)`, `c = (γ − 1 − log 2π)/2`, UNCONDITIONALLY — Lagarias,
    *Ann. Inst. Fourier* 57 (2007) 1689–1740, Thm 5.1; Voros pins the ζ-case `O(1)` to
    exactly `+3/4` — while RH holds iff the arithmetic oscillation stays subdominant).
    A single `B` (itself of either sign, slice by slice) expresses both regimes uniformly.
    The general-`n` archimedean closed form
    `λₙ^{∞} = 1 − (n/2)(γ + log 4π) + Σ_{j=2}^n (−1)ʲ C(n,j)(1 − 2^{−j})ζ(j)`
    (Voros eqs. 20–21; Coffey arXiv math-ph/0505052 Thm 1) matches the built `n = 1, 2`
    slices exactly.

THE THEOREMS. For any sequences satisfying the trace identity at positive indices:
      `dominated_liPositive`     : Dominated arith arch → LiPositive lam
      `liPositive_dominated`     : LiPositive lam → Dominated arith arch
      `dominated_iff_liPositive` : Dominated arith arch ⟺ LiPositive lam
      `dominance_crux_equivalent`: Dominated arith arch ⟺ SpectralCrux S   (through the
                                   v0.18.0 bridge — so the crux now has THREE equivalent
                                   faces: geometric `⟨Cₙ,Cₙ⟩ < 0 ∀n`, analytic `λₙ > 0 ∀n`,
                                   and dominance `∃ one bound under which oscillation
                                   loses`)
      `weilTrace_dominance`      : Dominated W.primePart W.archPart ⟺ LiCrux W.zeroSide
                                   (the dominance reading of the completed explicit-formula
                                   trace).

FAITHFULNESS (the standing discipline, enforced):
  • The equivalence RELOCATES the difficulty; it does not remove it (the Conrey–Li
    discipline, *IMRN* 2000 — positivity reformulations never make RH easier; the
    one-sided-bound shape is published only as a SUFFICIENCY conjecture, Coffey
    arXiv math-ph/0505052 Conjectures 2–3 — the equivalence-by-regrouping is this
    module's theorem). What the relocation buys is the honest pinpoint, and the
    formulation is EXACTLY two-sided per the verified literature [CLASSICAL, all
    deep-research-verified against the primary PDFs]:
      – VOROS'S DICHOTOMY (*Math. Phys. Anal. Geom.* 9 (2006) 53–63, arXiv
        math/0506326 — "two sharply distinct and mutually exclusive asymptotic forms",
        NO third option): RH ⟺ `λₙ ~ ½n(log n − 1 + γ − log 2π)` mod `o(n)` (tempered);
        ¬RH ⟺ `λₙ ~ Σ_{arg τₖ>0} ((τₖ+i/2)/(τₖ−i/2))ⁿ + c.c.` mod `o(e^{εn})` —
        exponential oscillation, rate `|1 − 1/ρ| > 1` for the `Re ρ < 1/2` member of
        each off-line pair (rigorous via the Darboux argument of the 2006 paper; the
        2004 note math/0404213 carries a known sign erratum in this branch and is NOT
        the source).
      – UNDER RH the dominance bound genuinely EXISTS with room to spare: the
        arithmetic part's excursions obey `O(√n·log n)` (Lagarias 2007 Thm 6.1 — a
        THEOREM under RH) against the unconditional `(n/2)·log n` trend; unconditionally
        `λₙ^{arith}` equals the zero sum truncated at height `√n` up to `O(√n·log n)`
        (Lagarias Thm 1.1/6.1).
      – UNDER ¬RH no sub-trend bound can exist: the arithmetic part itself acquires the
        full exponential amplitude (Bombieri–Lagarias 1999 Thm 1(c); Voros eqs. 25–26)
        and defeats EVERY bound dominated by the archimedean trend.
    So `Dominated` for the genuine parts is TRUE iff RH — both directions confirmed at
    the asymptotic level; proving it IS proving RH. No unconditional tail bound exists
    in the verified literature (else RH would be a theorem); it is exactly as open as
    the crux, and stays so here.
  • Two-sidedness: the property is satisfiable (`dominance_satisfiable` — no hidden
    impossibility in the encoding, and the loose existential `∃ arith arch, Dominated …`
    is true and hence NOT RH), and the realized two-slice instance provably FAILS it
    (`twoSlice_not_dominated`, via `weilTraceTwo_not_crux`): no finite assembly of
    certified slices acquires the universal through this face either — the guard
    transfers to the dominance face.
  • The crux fields stay `none`: nothing here asserts `Dominated` for the genuine parts.

-- ===========================================================================

/-- **The dominance bound**: `B` controls the arithmetic part's negative excursions
    (`−B(n) ≤ arith(n)`) while staying strictly below the archimedean trend
    (`arch(n) − B(n) > 0`) — at every positive index, via the SAME `B`. Sign-agnostic in
    both parts: no case split between the small-`n` regime (archimedean part negative,
    arithmetic part positive) and the asymptotic regime (roles swapped). -/

/-- **The dominance face**: SOME single bound dominates — the oscillation loses, for all
    `n`, via one object. For the genuine arithmetic/archimedean parts this is RH
    (`dominance_crux_equivalent`); it is never asserted for them here. -/

/-- **Dominance suffices**: if one bound dominates, every `λₙ` is strictly positive —
    `λₙ = arith(n) + arch(n) ≥ arch(n) − B(n) > 0`. The proof is the one-line order
    algebra; no enumeration, no asymptotics: the single bound carries the universal. -/

/-- **Dominance is necessary**: if every `λₙ` is strictly positive, the bound
    `B(n) := arch(n) − λₙ` dominates — `−B(n) ≈ arith(n)` (so the excursion control is
    tight) and `arch(n) − B(n) ≈ λₙ > 0`. So the dominance face loses nothing. -/

-- ===========================================================================

/-- **THE THIRD FACE — the v0.19.0 keystone**: for any spectral square whose trace data
    satisfies the explicit-formula split, the dominance face is equivalent to the
    geometric crux (and hence, through `crux_faces_equivalent`, to the analytic one):
        `∃ one bound under which oscillation loses  ⟺  ⟨Cₙ,Cₙ⟩ < 0 ∀n  ⟺  λₙ > 0 ∀n`.
    For the genuine instance all three are RH; none is asserted. The equivalence is a
    constructive theorem — the difficulty is RELOCATED into the single bound `B`, whose
    existence for the genuine parts is governed by the zeros' location (module
    docstring). -/

/-- **The head–tail assembly**: a certified head (`λₙ > 0` for `n ≤ N₀`, slice by slice)
    plus a tail bound (one `B` dominating from `N₀ + 1` on) delivers the full universal.
    This is the shape a genuine closure would take in this substrate: the head is the
    numeric frontier (certified through `n = 2` today, `spectral_strict_upTo_two`); the
    missing object is the TAIL bound for the genuine parts — a single bound on the
    arithmetic oscillation strictly below the archimedean trend for all `n ≥ N₀ + 1`,
    classically governed by the zeros' location (module docstring). The theorem makes the
    route exact without asserting any of its inputs for the genuine sequences. -/

/-- **The closure route, exact**: for a spectral square satisfying the trace, the
    certified two-slice head (held today: `liTwo_evidence` through the dictionary) plus a
    tail bound from `n = 3` on yields the crux. This is `crux_attempt_frontier` in
    constructive form on the dominance face: everything is in place EXCEPT the tail
    bound for the genuine parts — which is exactly as open as RH, and is asserted for
    nothing here. -/
