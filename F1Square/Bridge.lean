F1 square — the bridges, and the §2.3 CONTROL, as proof-layer theorems.

Two honest connective results (pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`):

  • The mechanism bridge: on `{F_h,F_v,Δ,Γ_q}`, Hodge type `(1, ρ−1)` ⟹ the spectral bound
    `a² ≤ 4q` (`|a| ≤ 2√q`) — over `𝔽_q` this is RH-for-the-curve (companion §0.3). A corollary
    of `Mechanism.hodgeType_iff`.

  • The §2.3 control, mechanized. The shift-length Weil-type Gram is
    `W_ij = Σ_zeros cos(γ(δ_i − δ_j))`. By the cosine difference identity each frequency γ
    contributes `cos(γδ_i)cos(γδ_j) + sin(γδ_i)sin(γδ_j)` — a rank-1 `cc^T + s s^T`. So its
    quadratic form at coefficients `x` is `(c·x)² + (s·x)²`, which is `≥ 0` for ANY samples
    `c, s` — i.e. for ANY real spectrum γ, zeros or not. PSD-ness is therefore automatic and
    carries NO information about whether the γ are real (= RH): it is a control, not evidence.
    The theorem quantifies over all samples — that universal quantifier IS the vacuity.
