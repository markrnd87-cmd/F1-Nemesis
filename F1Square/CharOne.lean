F1 square — the characteristic-1 (max-plus / tropical) base, as a UOR-style realization.

Companion `characteristic_1_constructions.md` R1–R12. Canonical form: the max-plus semiring
`ℝ_max = (ℝ∪{−∞}, max, +)`, here modelled in pure Lean 4 (no Mathlib) over `Option Int`
(`none = −∞`). Invariants proved — no `sorry`:
  • R1: tropical addition is idempotent (`x ⊕ x = x`) — the defining characteristic-1 trait;
  • the semiring shape: `⊕` commutative with identity `−∞`, `⊗` commutative with identity `0`,
    `−∞` absorbing for `⊗`;
  • R12: a cycle and its reversal have equal total weight and equal length — hence equal cycle
    mean, i.e. `spectrum(W) = spectrum(Wᵀ)` at the cycle level (the tropical functional equation).
Tropical intersection-positivity (R13) lives in `Mechanism.lean` (`tropMult_nonneg`).

Scope: the κ Kleene-star closure and the full κ⊥spectrum search (R9/R10) need a tropical
matrix-closure module; the trace-count side (R6) is mechanized exactly in `CycleCounts.lean`.
