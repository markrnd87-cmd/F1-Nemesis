/-
F1 square — **`Pos λ₂`** (the second Li coefficient is positive), the capstone of the v0.16.0 stage-B
release. By the Bombieri–Lagarias / Coffey closed form,

    λ₂  =  1 + γ − γ²  −  2γ₁  −  log 4π  +  ¾·ζ(2),

with `γ` the Euler–Mascheroni constant, `γ₁` the first Stieltjes constant, `ζ(2)` the Basel constant.
Every constituent is now a constructive real with a *kernel-certified* bracket:

  • `1 + γ − γ² ≥ 1.2244`  — the **parabola** `(γ − 0.34)(0.66 − γ) ≥ 0` on `γ ∈ [0.54, 0.66]`
    (`Rgamma_h_lower`/`Rgamma_h_upper`), expanded to `γ − γ² ≥ 0.2244` (`parab_gen`),
  • `−2γ₁ ≥ 0.089`         — from `γ₁ ≤ −0.0445` (`Rgamma1_le_neg445`, the v0.16.0 γ₁ numeric),
  • `−log 4π ≥ −2.531556`  — from `log 2 ≤ 0.6931` (`Rlog2c_le`) and `log π ≤ 1.1453` (`Rlogπc_le`),
  • `¾·ζ(2) ≥ 1.2225`      — from `ζ(2) ≥ 1.63` (`zeta2_lower`).

Summing the rational brackets gives `λ₂ ≥ 0.004344 > 0` — razor-thin but kernel-decidable. This is the
`n = 2` slice of Li's criterion as **evidence**; it is NOT the crux (`λₙ > 0 ∀ n` = RH stays open, the
`liPositivityHolds` field remains `none`).

Pure Lean 4, no Mathlib, no `sorry`/`native_decide`, choice-free.
