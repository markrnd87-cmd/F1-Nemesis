F1 square — v0.20.0 stage F: **the third Li coefficient `λ₃` in closed form**, the next rung of the
genuine λ-ladder, built on the constructive `γ₂` (`Rgamma2`).

The genuine Li sequence `λₙ = λₙ^{arith} + λₙ^{∞}` (`GenuineLi.lean`) is already general in `n`; its
arithmetic side is `λₙ^{arith} = −Σ_{j=1}^n C(n,j)·η_{j−1}` and the η-convention is anchored by
`η₀ = −γ`, `η₁ = γ² + 2γ₁` (the v0.15.3 / v0.18.0 slices). THIS FILE adds the next anchor —
deep-research-confirmed against Bombieri–Lagarias / Coffey / Keiper–Li:

    η₂  =  −γ³ − 3γγ₁ − (3/2)γ₂,

the FIRST anchor that needs the second Stieltjes constant `γ₂` (`Rgamma2`, the v0.20.0 dyadic-tail
construction). With it, `λ₃^{arith} = −(3η₀ + 3η₁ + η₂)` is a constructive object, and the closed
form meets the genuine ladder at `n = 3` (`genuineLam_three`) exactly as it did at `n = 1, 2`. The
archimedean side `λ₃^{∞} = genuineArchSeq 3` (needing `ζ(2), ζ(3)`) is already the general
construction — no new work.

WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT DO. This completes the `λ₃` OBJECT (the closed-form constructive real)
and its consistency with the ladder. It does NOT prove `Pos λ₃`: that needs a tight numeric bracket
on `γ₂` (the `η₂` coefficient is `3/2`), which is gated by the Euler–Maclaurin sharp-tail machinery
(γ₂'s `ln²N/N` tail is heavier than γ₁'s clean `1/(2N)`) — the documented open computational
frontier. The crux fields stay `none`.
