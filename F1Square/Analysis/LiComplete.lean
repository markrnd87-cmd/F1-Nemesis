F1 square — v0.19.0 stage E, bricks 1–2 (analysis layer): the COMPLETE explicit-formula
trace (the zero side, realized at the Bombieri–Lagarias slices) and the retirement of the
`Li.LiAgreesWith` interface at the built slices.

THE THREE SIDES OF THE WEIL EXPLICIT FORMULA in this substrate:
  • the PRIME side — built since v0.15.3 (`Analysis.Mangoldt.primeSide`: the finite sums
    `Σ_{m ≤ N} Λ(m)·h(log m)`, stable past the support of `h`, `primeSide_stable`);
  • the ARCHIMEDEAN side — built since v0.16.0 (`Analysis.Gamma.Digamma`: the exact
    `ψ = Γ′/Γ` place, `ψ(1) = −γ`);
  • the ZERO side — `Σ` over the nontrivial zeros. THE ZEROS ARE NOT CONSTRUCTED here; what
    is constructive is the Bombieri–Lagarias reading [CLASSICAL] (Bombieri–Lagarias,
    *J. Number Theory* 77 (1999), 274–287): at the BL test functions the zero side IS the
    Li coefficient, `λₙ = Σ_ρ [1 − (1−1/ρ)ⁿ]` (paired/symmetric sum), and the explicit
    formula evaluates it as `λₙ = λₙ^{arith} + λₙ^{∞}`. The arithmetic part is the
    finite-place (prime-side) contribution — as a CLOSED FORM it is the polynomial in the
    Stieltjes constants built here (`Rlambda1_arith = γ`, `Rlambda2_arith = 2γ − (γ²+2γ₁)`);
    its identification with the literal `−Σ Λ(m)·wₙ(m)` prime sums needs the `ζ′/ζ`
    continuation [CLASSICAL] — the standing LiOne hedge, unchanged. The archimedean parts
    are built (`Rlambda1_arch`, `Rlambda2_arch`).

CONVENTION NOTE (deep-research-verified): Lagarias (*Ann. Inst. Fourier* 57 (2007),
eq. (1.11)) keeps the pole term separate — `λₙ = S∞(n) − S_f(n) + 1`; the
Bombieri–Lagarias grouping used here folds the `+1` into the archimedean part:
`λₙ^{arith} = −S_f(n)`, `λₙ^{∞} = S∞(n) + 1` (numerically confirmed against both built
slices to 30 digits). The arithmetic closed form is sourced from the η-polynomial form
(`λₙ^{arith} = −Σ_{j=1}^n C(n,j)·η_{j−1}`, Voros eq. 20 / Lagarias eq. (4.8)); the arXiv
print of Lagarias eq. (4.13) carries a sign typo and is not used. Unconditionally the
finite-place part equals the zero sum truncated at height `√n` up to `O(√n·log n)`
(Lagarias Thm 6.1) — the precise sense in which the prime side IS an incomplete zero side.

THE COMPLETION (roadmap E, first goal). `Li.ExplicitFormulaTrace` — until now inhabited
only by the trivial split `z = z + 0` (`explicitFormulaTrace_genuine`) — is REALIZED with
the genuine three-sided reading at both built slices (`explicitFormulaTrace_one_realized`,
`explicitFormulaTrace_two_realized`), and packaged as the `WeilTrace` ladder: a zero side,
a finite-place part, an archimedean part, and the trace identity at every positive index
(`weilTraceTwo`). Completing the TRACE (the equality) bears NO positivity content — what
stays open is exactly the crux, positivity of the zero side for all `n` (= RH through
`Square.crux_faces_equivalent`); the not-the-crux guard for this instance is a theorem on
the square side (`Square.weilTraceTwo_not_crux`).

THE RETIREMENT (roadmap E, second goal). `Li.LiAgreesWith` — until now inhabited only
reflexively (`liAgreesWith_genuine`) — is realized with two genuinely DISTINCT routes to
the same values (`liAgreesWith_two_realized`): computed = the direct certified builds
(`Rlambda1` via the accelerated-γ assembly, v0.14.0; `Rlambda2` via the Stieltjes/ζ(2)
assembly, v0.16.0); classical = the Bombieri–Lagarias closed-form assemblies
(`liClassicalSeqTwo`). Their agreement at the built slices is the non-trivial content of
`Rlambda1_decomposition`/`Rlambda2_decomposition`. The hedge, stated exactly: the right
side equals the classical `λₙ` (the zero-sum) by [CLASSICAL] Bombieri–Lagarias 1999; what
is mechanized is build-vs-closed-form agreement. Beyond `n = 2` both sequences are the
same trivial value (the higher slices await `γ₂, γ₃, …`) — the interface is retired AT the
built slices, never asserted beyond them.
