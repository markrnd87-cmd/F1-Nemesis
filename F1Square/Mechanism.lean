F1 square — the genuine-proof layer.

This module is the REAL Lean proof layer for the program (companion docs
`f1_square_intersection_theory.md`, `missing_object_over_Q.md`,
`characteristic_1_constructions.md`). Unlike `F1Square.lean` — which records the
construction's *epistemic status* as UOR ontology data (`universallyValid : Option Bool`) —
this module states load-bearing claims as honest Lean `theorem`s with real proofs.

Discipline (matching the UOR Lean corpus, verified zero-`sorry`):
  * NO `sorry`, NO `axiom`, NO `native_decide`, NO `partial def`.
  * For now, only [VERIFIED] / [CLASSICAL] boundary/shadow facts are proved here.
  * NO ARBITRARY CEILING on the crux. The Hodge index theorem for `Spec ℤ ×_𝔽₁ Spec ℤ`
    IS the Riemann Hypothesis. We do NOT forbid proving it: if a genuine, axiom-clean proof of
    a FAITHFUL statement ever lands and survives the audit, that is a result, and the manifest
    status flips `none → some true` because that is then the truth. What is forbidden is
    *fooling ourselves* — hidden `sorry`/`axiom`/`native_decide`, circular or vacuous positivity
    (the §2.3 control discipline), and mislabeling a finite SHADOW as the crux. In this pure
    (no-Mathlib) setting we cannot yet even *state* RH faithfully (no ℂ, no ζ), so every theorem
    here is a boundary/shadow fact, labeled as such — not the summit mistaken for the climb.

/-! ## 1. The Hodge-index signature governor — the function-field mechanism, integer core

On the Néron–Severi lattice `{F_h, F_v, Δ, Γ_q}` of `C × C` with `Δ·Γ_q = q + 1 − a`
(companion §0.3 / §9.1), the intersection form is of Hodge type `(1, ρ−1)` exactly when the
arithmetic 2-plane's Gram determinant is sign-correct, which reduces to the sign of `4q − a²`.
The analytic-looking Hasse bound `|a| ≤ 2√q` is, over `ℤ`, the square-root-free integer
condition `a² ≤ 4q`. This is the *verified boundary mechanism* — it forces RH-for-curves on a
genuine surface — and is emphatically NOT the crux (which is the same positivity on the
*unbuilt* `𝔽₁` square). -/

/-- The signature governor `4q − a²`. Its sign decides the Hodge type. -/

/-! ## 2. Tropical intersection-positivity — companion R13 / §8.4

The stable-intersection multiplicity of two tropical curve-edges with primitive directions
`u, v` and lattice weights `mu, mv` is `mu · mv · |det(u, v)|` — a non-negative integer by
construction. This positivity is *free* in characteristic 1; its `ℤ`-analogue on the square is
exactly the open crux. Proving the shadow is honest precisely because it is only the shadow. -/
