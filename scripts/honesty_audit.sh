# proving anything, it forbids fooling ourselves. This script enforces that the proof layer is
# axiom-clean — no `sorry`, no `native_decide`, no stray `axiom` — via `#print axioms`, which is
# authoritative (textual greps would false-positive on the docstrings that *discuss* sorry).

#     drift and a `sorry` cannot hide in an un-audited leaf lemma.

#    §4.1 smuggling corner). This is the metric analog of `intrinsicH1_dict`'s "no false dictionary
#    can be supplied": the Gate-A pairing `gramOf` / `atlasPair` is λ-free, so a successful match
#    genuinely EXHIBITS λ as a sum of squares rather than asserting it. We verify structurally that
#    those definitions reference none of `genuineLamSeq` / `.lam` / `cSq` / `StieltjesEta`. Same
